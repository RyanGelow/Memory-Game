# Memory Game / Clicky Game

1. This responsive web game tests the player's memory with 12 rotating square images. The object of the game is to click on each image only once until all 12 images have been clicked without any repeats. After each image is clicked, the images are randomly re-ordered for the next turn.

2. This game was built in ReactJs and utilized components to render the game's functionality. This game has one page and features a card class that renders the src image links within objects in an array. The game begins with one click on an image and the score begins to climb. As more images are clicked without repeat the high score counter also increases.  

3. Here are a few photos of the game in progress:
